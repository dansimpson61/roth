This document outlines a specification for a multi-year tax analysis application, conceived through the lens of a distinct development philosophy. Crucially, this tool is designed not as a substitute for thorough financial planning or formal accounting, but as a high-level tool for prospective estimation. Its primary aim is to provide 'good-enough' directional insights that enable reasonable budgeting and strategic foresight. Drawing inspiration from the "Ode to Joy - Ruby and Sinatra," this specification details a holistic approach where the tool's intentional simplicity and elegance are its greatest strengths. By merging this pragmatic estimation with the powerful visual clarity championed by Edward R. Tufte, the application aims to transform a complex forecasting challenge into an intuitive and insightful experience, reflecting the spirit of software as a craft.

### **Part 1: The Multi-Year Analysis Engine Specification**

This engine forms the core logic of the application. It is a discrete component responsible for running financial simulations based on user-defined parameters. [cite_start]Its design will prioritize accuracy, robustness, and reliability[cite: 20].

#### **1.1. Input Parameters (The Configuration)**

The user must be able to configure the following variables to define a scenario:

* **A. User Profile:**
    * `Current Ages`: Separate inputs for the primary user and spouse.
    * `Tax Filing Status`: Dropdown (initially focused on "Married Filing Jointly").
    * `State of Residence`: Dropdown to load state-specific tax laws (e.g., NY retirement income exclusions).

* **B. Financial Snapshot:**
    * `Account Balances`: Inputs for Traditional IRA/401k, Roth IRA/401k.
    * `Annual Base Income`: Current pre-distribution income (e.g., salary, pension).
    * `Social Security Projections`: Estimated annual benefits and planned start year for both spouses.

* **C. Simulation Assumptions (with sensible defaults):**
    * `Investment Growth Rate`: Annual percentage growth for all investment accounts.
    * `Inflation Rate`: Affects tax brackets, deductions, and IRMAA thresholds.
    * `Base Income Growth`: Annual percentage increase in base income.
    * `Analysis Horizon`: Number of years to project (e.g., until age 95).

* **D. Roth Conversion Strategy:**
    * The user selects a primary goal for the annual conversion amount, which the engine will calculate each year:
        1.  **Fixed Amount:** Convert a specific dollar amount annually.
        2.  **Fill a Bracket:** Convert just enough to bring taxable income to the top of a selected federal tax bracket (e.g., `12%`, `22%`, `24%`).
        3.  **Target MAGI:** Convert just enough to reach a specific Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI), primarily to manage IRMAA thresholds.

#### **1.2. Core Calculation Logic**

The engine will run two parallel simulations for the chosen time horizon: the user's defined **Conversion Strategy** and a **"Do Nothing" Baseline**. For each year in a simulation, the engine will:

1.  **Age & Milestone Check:** Update user ages and check for key events (e.g., turning 59.5, 65, 73).
2.  **Inflate Financial Data:** Adjust tax brackets, standard deductions, and IRMAA thresholds based on the inflation parameter.
3.  **Project Account Growth:** Apply the investment growth rate to the start-of-year balances of all accounts.
4.  **Determine Conversion Amount:** Based on the user's chosen strategy, calculate the precise Roth conversion amount for the current year.
5.  **Calculate Income:** Sum all sources of income: Base Income + Social Security (if applicable) + Roth Conversion amount + RMDs (if applicable).
6.  **Calculate Tax Liability:**
    * **Federal:** Apply age-based standard deductions. Calculate Federal AGI, MAGI, and Taxable Income. Compute the final tax using the projected brackets.
    * **State:** Apply state-specific rules (e.g., NY retirement income exclusion for eligible spouses). Calculate State Taxable Income and compute the final tax.
7.  **Calculate IRMAA Impact:** Determine the MAGI for the current year. This MAGI will be stored and applied as a potential Medicare premium surcharge two years in the future.
8.  **Calculate RMDs:** Once the user reaches RMD age, calculate the Required Minimum Distribution from the remaining Traditional IRA balance. This becomes non-discretionary taxable income.
9.  **Update Account Balances:** Adjust account balances based on growth, conversions, and RMDs to establish the end-of-year figures.

#### **1.3. Output Data**

The engine will produce a comprehensive dataset for both the Conversion Strategy and the Baseline scenario, ready for visualization:
* **Year-by-Year Table:** A detailed breakdown for each year including ages, all income sources, conversion amounts, RMDs, tax liabilities, IRMAA surcharge costs, and end-of-year account balances.
* **Summary Metrics:** Lifetime totals for taxes paid, Roth conversions, and RMDs. Final projected net worth and the projected balance of tax-free (Roth) vs. tax-deferred (Traditional) assets.

### **Part 2: The "Joyful" Application Specification (UX/UI)**

[cite_start]This specification details the user-facing application, designed to be a pleasure to use[cite: 16]. [cite_start]It will embody joyful Ruby elegance and Sinatra's minimalism, creating a tool that is powerful yet simple, clear, and beautiful[cite: 5, 10, 68].

#### **2.1. Guiding Philosophy**

* **Simplicity and Focus:** The application will do one thing perfectly: model and visualize the long-term impact of Roth conversion strategies. [cite_start]It will resist feature creep, embodying Sinatra's minimalist ethos[cite: 68].
* **Clarity and Honesty:** The design will adhere to Edward Tufte's principles of graphical excellence. The goal is to clearly convey complex information, enabling insight and understanding. The data is the star; the interface is a quiet, elegant servant to it.
* [cite_start]**Effortless Interaction:** Working with the app will be smooth and frictionless[cite: 14]. [cite_start]It will follow the Principle of Least Astonishment [cite: 55][cite_start], behaving as the user intuitively expects[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Craftsmanship:** The application will be approached as a craft, with a commitment to quality and attention to detail in every aspect of its design and implementation[cite: 42, 46].

#### **2.2. User Experience and Interface Design**

* **Screen 1: The Parameter Dashboard ("The Controls")**
    * A single, clean page for all inputs. Related parameters will be grouped logically.
    * **Interactive Controls:** Sliders will be used for rates (growth, inflation) and dollar amounts. As a user adjusts a slider, a "sparkline" chart next to it will update in real-time, showing the impact of that single variable on a key outcome (e.g., "Final Total Assets"). [cite_start]This provides immediate, playful feedback[cite: 12].
    * **Clear Prose:** The interface will use plain language. [cite_start]Instead of "Conversion Strategy," it will ask, "What is your yearly Roth conversion goal?"[cite: 6].

* **Screen 2: The Analysis Dashboard ("The Tufte Display")**
    * This screen presents the output of the simulation. It will be a dense, high-information display that is nonetheless clean and easy to parse.
    * **Primary Visualization (The Story):** A large, stacked area chart showing the progression of assets over the chosen time horizon.
        * **X-Axis:** Year (e.g., 2025 -> 2055).
        * **Y-Axis:** Value in Dollars.
        * **Layers:** Color-coded areas representing the Traditional IRA balance and the Roth IRA balance.
        * **Comparison:** A toggle or split-screen control will instantly switch between the "Conversion Strategy" and the "Do Nothing" baseline, allowing for powerful visual comparison.
        * **Overlays:** A clean line graph will be superimposed to show the annual total tax liability, making the cost of conversions immediately apparent.
        * **Event Annotations:** Key milestones (Medicare start, RMDs begin) will be marked directly on the chart with elegant, non-intrusive labels.
    * **Secondary Visualizations (The Details):**
        * **IRMAA Timeline:** A horizontal bar below the main chart, representing the analysis horizon. Each year segment will be color-coded based on the projected IRMAA tier (e.g., green for none, yellow for Tier 2, red for Tier 3). Hovering over a year will show the exact MAGI and the future surcharge cost.
        * **Tax Efficiency Gauge:** A simple visual (like a donut chart or bar) summarizing the projected ratio of tax-free assets (Roth) to tax-deferred assets (Traditional) at the end of the time horizon, shown for both scenarios.
    * **Data Table (The Numbers):** Below the visuals, a detailed year-by-year data table will be available. Each row will use sparklines to visualize trends for key columns like `Taxes Paid` and `Account Balance`, blending text and graphics seamlessly.

#### **2.3. Technical Implementation (Embodying the "Ode")**

* [cite_start]**Backend:** Ruby and Sinatra will be used for their expressiveness and minimalist approach, allowing for the creation of an elegant and maintainable system[cite: 1, 82]. [cite_start]The code will be well-structured, leveraging excellent OOP principles to ensure clear responsibilities and encapsulation[cite: 27, 28].
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** The frontend will be built with Slim templates for their joy-inducing, clean syntax [cite: 86] [cite_start]and StimulusJS to apply behavior with the "least javascript" possible, avoiding the "intentional ugliness" of heavier frameworks[cite: 87, 88].
* [cite_start]**Development Practices:** The entire process will value excellent collaboration and communication[cite: 37, 38]. [cite_start]The code will be thoroughly tested [cite: 54][cite_start], version controlled [cite: 24][cite_start], and continuously refactored to maintain clarity and simplicity[cite: 61].
